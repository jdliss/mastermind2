## MASTERMIND

  ***Mastermind*** is a color code guessing game.  The computer will generate
  a combination of color codes represented by the first letter of each color.

  For example, at the beginning difficulty, a generated code would look
  something like this : RGBY

  It's up to the user to guess the combination.  The computer will provide
  hints about how many colors were correct, and how many of them are in the
  correct place in the sequence.

  At the beginning the user can also select one of three difficulty levels:
  * 4 - 4 character sequence, 4 colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow.

  * 6 - 6 character sequence, 5 colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta.

  * 8 - 8 character sequence, 6 colors: Red,      Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta, Cyan.


  Each sequence is only guaranteed to contain at least one color.  So there's a chance a sequence could be RRRRRRRR or CCCCCCCC, consider this when making guesses.

  If you are a morally compromised individual, there is a hidden cheat ability thats available anytime a guess can be made.  This will have no impact on the game, however you will have to live with the burden of guilt.

  Follow the on screen prompts to play. Good luck!
